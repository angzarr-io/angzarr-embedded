//! The storage ports are angzarr-ports': one async trait set, shared with
//! angzarr, held to one conformance suite (`angzarr_ports::contract`), with
//! an in-memory backend (`angzarr_ports::memory::MemoryStore`, feature
//! `memory`) and a SQLite one (angzarr-store-sqlite). angzarr-embedded has no store
//! trait of its own, and re-exports the shared ones here.
//!
//! **There is no unit of work.** Each handling step the kernel runs makes
//! ONE atomic [`EventStore::write`]: one stream's events at the length the
//! step loaded, with the step's positions, landing together or not at all.
//! A race is caught by that length ([`StoreError::Conflict`]); nothing is
//! held open between a step's reads and its write. A step's dedup lookup
//! comes before its write; a snapshot is its own call.
//!
//! **What the kernel needs of a store** is the base ports, [`Store`]: it
//! reads snapshots, streams and positions, looks commands up, and writes,
//! a step's dead letters in its write (kept by a store that is a
//! [`DeadLetterStore`], dropped by one that is not).
//! The rest (purge, read units, watch, the outbox, editions) is the
//! application's, through the store directly.
//!
//! **Opaque.** A store keeps angzarr's pages as written and never decodes a
//! payload; upcasting is the kernel's, on every read. A page the kernel
//! cannot replay is the kernel's [`KernelError::Unreadable`](super::KernelError::Unreadable);
//! a store's [`StoreError::Unreadable`] is bytes the store cannot return.
//!
//! **Absent is empty.** A stream with no events reads as an empty
//! [`Slice`] at 0: "no such stream" and "empty" are one answer, so a
//! snapshot whose stream has no events is never used.
//!
//! **Editions** are per-stream forks (14.32), the store's to enforce: an
//! edition stream never forked reads as main's, and a write to it is
//! refused ([`StoreError::EditionNotForked`]). The kernel reads the fork
//! from the stream it loads, and refuses every input to an unforked
//! edition stream, a client's or a reaction's, at its load, before business
//! code (`ANGZARR_REASON_EDITION_NOT_FORKED`): a client is answered, a
//! reaction is dead-lettered. The kernel creates no edition.
