//! Steps 3 to 5 of the pipeline: the in-process coordinator, over
//! angzarr-router.
//!
//! angzarr's aggregate coordinator is a service that loads a stream, checks
//! the command's expected sequence and hands a `HandleRequest` to business
//! code. angzarr-embedded has no service and sends nothing: the chain does
//! the same steps in process, through the store, domain-blind (it sees
//! `Cover`s, pages and the [`Registry`], never a domain's types), and hands
//! the `HandleRequest` to the domain's router (its `CommandHandler`), which
//! owns the business rules (docs/design/pipeline.md §2):
//!
//! 3. [`deduplicate`]: **load the stream first** (the newest usable
//!    snapshot, of the registered state type and its rules version
//!    compatible with the registered one,
//!    [`Catalog::snapshot_usable`](super::Catalog::snapshot_usable), below
//!    the head, then the events after it), refuse an input to an edition
//!    stream not forked there (the not-forked rule, decision 14.107),
//!    **then** look the command id up (the store's `find_command`), and
//!    [`admit`] the input (deduplication by the events found, a process
//!    manager's start rule). Events found are answered
//!    [`Deduplicated::Duplicate`], and nothing below runs. The load comes
//!    first so that a concurrent commit of the same command (a retry
//!    racing its original) can never slip between the two reads unseen.
//! 4. [`load`]: a command whose expected sequence is not the head step 3
//!    loaded is refused `ExpectedSequenceMismatch` (decisions 14.93 and
//!    14.94), behind or ahead alike, and its handler never runs. There is no
//!    conflict concept (decision 14.92).
//! 5. [`decide`]: the `HandleRequest` (the stream's snapshot and events,
//!    upcast; the input with its ids, its payload upcast through the
//!    domain's port before step 3 decided anything by its type, decision
//!    14.39; the instant it was accepted; a reaction's causation) through
//!    the router, whose handler decides or records; the kernel stamps every
//!    event it answers with
//!    [`CommandContext::event_meta`](angzarr_router::domain::CommandContext::event_meta)
//!    of the request's context and the rules version the answer reports,
//!    which must be the registered one, as its state's type must be the
//!    registered state's. The router catches a panicking handler, a bug.
