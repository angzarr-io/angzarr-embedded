//! The command handler: a command, then every policy step it sets off, each
//! committed on its own: atomicity covers one handling step, never a
//! chain.
//!
//! [`Kernel::handle`] runs the book through the five steps (validate,
//! identify, load then deduplicate, check the expected sequence, decide or
//! ingest) and writes its events: ONE atomic write to the store, at the
//! head the step loaded. Then every policy of its domain runs on those
//! events, one call per trigger event, each output a step of its own in its
//! target, written with the policy's position on the source; whose events
//! set off their own policies, stream by stream in the order written,
//! until the chain settles. The call waits for it.
//!
//! - **A duplicate** (step 3 finds the command's events on its stream) is
//!   answered [`Handled::Duplicate`] with them, once its stream's policies
//!   have run whatever they still owe (a retry after a crash finishes the
//!   chain).
//! - **A failing step keeps every write before it**: nothing is rolled
//!   back. The failure goes back to the caller with the path to the step
//!   ([`Failure::Downstream`]). A policy's own error
//!   ([`StepError::PolicyFailed`], a defect, dead-lettered by its code and
//!   args) and a handler's bug in the step (a [`KernelError::Router`]
//!   dead-lettered by its code and args) move the position past the trigger,
//!   unless the kernel keeps it there ([`OnPolicyBug::Stay`]); any other
//!   bug (a malformed reaction, the depth limit) or a store failure holds
//!   the position, so [`Kernel::resume`] runs the step again, deduplicated
//!   by its derived command id.
//! - **Dead letters are durable** (owner ruling Q5): a step with no caller
//!   left keeps each letter it raises in the store, in the same write as
//!   the position it moves past (or alone, when the position stays), and
//!   every call answers the letters it kept ([`Handled::dead_letters`],
//!   [`Failure::dead_letters`]). The originating command's own failure is
//!   its caller's: answered, its line logged, never kept; but a fact that
//!   cannot be recorded is dead-lettered, its letter kept, and its sender
//!   answered [`KernelError::FactDeadLettered`] (decisions 14.100, 14.109).
//! - **A command refused with a typed refusal** reaches its policy's ONE
//!   Translate callback (decision 14.89): the fact it answers goes to the
//!   stream of the triggering event as a step of its own, with the refused
//!   command's id. A policy that does not translate answers a bug, and the
//!   refused command is dead-lettered. A reaction the framework refuses
//!   (not forked in its edition, no process manager instance) is
//!   dead-lettered and never translated: its letter is its record, the
//!   step is done and the chain goes on, as for a fact dead-lettered at its
//!   destination.
//! - **Projectors run inline** on what each step wrote, each the
//!   projector port ([`Registry::projector_handler`]; a marked-up one,
//!   [`Registry::projector`]; one in another process): its failures, by
//!   their class (retried, then dead-lettered, or dead-lettered at once),
//!   are the caller's [`Failure::Projection`]. A failing projection never
//!   undoes a write. A projector caught up from the store instead is a
//!   [`CatchUp`](super::CatchUp)'s.
//! - **A SIMPLE call** ([`Kernel::handle_sync`], [`super::sync`]) is this
//!   call, answering the projections of the projectors it names, whose
//!   failure (or deadline) is its caller's, never dead-lettered.
//!
//! Which policies run is the registry's one list
//! ([`Registry::policy`]), in registration order, so a chain can come back
//! to a stream it already touched (A → B → A); a cascade deeper than the
//! chain's limit is a [`KernelError::ChainTooDeep`], which is how a cycle
//! that never settles ends.
