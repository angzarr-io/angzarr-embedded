//! Errors, kept apart by whose they are: a domain's rejection is for the
//! person who gave the command; a [`Malformed`] book is the caller's; a
//! [`KernelError`] is a fault in delivery, storage or a log, for the
//! operator.
//!
//! Each is a [`Diagnostic`]. A condition the spec keys is coded under its
//! key, verbatim (`ANGZARR_REASON_RETRY_CAP_EXHAUSTED`), its args
//! the key's, and its English is the spec's catalog
//! (`angzarr_proto::REASONS_EN_US`; decision 14.60); every other is coded
//! under the crate's name (`code!("...")`), its messages in
//! `locales/en-US/messages.ftl` ([`EN_US`](crate::EN_US)). A wrapper of another error
//! ([`Failure::Rejected`], [`Failure::Kernel`], [`StepError`],
//! [`KernelError::Malformed`], [`KernelError::Replay`],
//! [`KernelError::Store`], [`KernelError::Router`], [`UpcastError::Payload`])
//! is that error's diagnostic. The store's errors are angzarr-ports'
//! `StoreError`, shared with angzarr: [`KernelError::Store`] forwards its
//! `angzarr-ports-*` code and args unchanged, rendered from angzarr-ports'
//! own catalog. Every error about a payload names its type URL; a stream
//! is named as `domain/root`, with `@edition` outside the main timeline.
