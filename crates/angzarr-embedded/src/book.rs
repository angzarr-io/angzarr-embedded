//! - [`CoverExt::natural`]: the stream of the entity a natural key names,
//!   its root the key's UUIDv5 under its domain ([`ids::compute_root`]),
//!   in the main edition.
//! - [`CommandBookExt::command`]: a client's command to a stream, with no

//! Both are extension traits on the wire types, so a book is still a
//! [`CommandBook`]: nothing parallel to angzarr's types.
