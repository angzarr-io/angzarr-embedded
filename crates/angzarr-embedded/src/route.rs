//! Where the kernel meets angzarr-router: the router owns business
//! dispatch (handlers, typed refusals, a decision's continuations); this
//! module turns what the router answers into the kernel's terms.
//!
//! - The router's answers keep their codes: a spec key (an
//!   `AngzarrReason`, the router's or the kernel's own, answered in the
//!   router's shape) is the kernel's code too, verbatim, with its args, so
//!   [`KernelError::Router`](super::KernelError::Router) needs no table
//!   (decision 14.60).
//! - [`Rejected`]: a domain's typed refusal, as the caller receives it
//!   (decision 14.95: typed refusals only): its key and args, its typed
//!   refusal object and the business status it travelled as.
//! - The table a typed [`Domain`] is dispatched by: the router's
//!   `DomainDispatch` over the domain's state, folding with the domain's
//!   own `apply`, with the state's codec; the domain's handlers are
//!   registered on it.
