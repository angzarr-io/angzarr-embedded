//! What angzarr-embedded-macros' expansion names: the runtime under a marked-up
//! aggregate or process manager (`#[aggregate]`, `#[process_manager]`,
//! `#[handles_cmd]`, `#[handles_fact]`, `#[on_refused]`, `#[applies]`),
//! policy (`#[policy]`, `#[on_event]`) and projector (`#[projector]`,
//! `#[projects]`); see angzarr-embedded-macros' crate docs. A hand-written
//! [`Domain`] needs none of it; a hand-written component that wants what
//! the markup does uses the same functions the expansion calls.
//!
//! - [`Context`]: a domain handler's third argument, what it may read
//!   besides itself and its input: one context, an aggregate's and a
//!   process manager's alike, its stream's root ([`Context::root`]) and
//!   whether a natural key is the stream's ([`Context::rooted_by`],
//!   [`NotItsStream`]: `#[handles_cmd(C, rooted_by = field)]`).
//! - [`PageContext`]: an applier's optional third argument, where its event
//!   sits: its stream, its sequence and its whole metadata.
//! - [`DomainMessage`]: a domain type (angzarr-codegen's domain layer) and
//!   the prost message it travels as, so the router decodes by type URL
//!   into domain types and never hands a handler a wire type.
//! - [`Emits`] and [`Emit`]: what a command handler's `Ok` may be. A shape
//!   (`E`, a tuple, `Option<E>`, `Vec<E>`) is events the router applies, in
//!   order; [`Emit::then`] adds a continuation step the router runs on the
//!   instance after them, within the same decision. It runs as
//!   angzarr-router's own `Emit` (decision 14.104), with no step cap.
//! - [`Record`] and [`Records`]: what a FACT handler returns: as [`Emit`],
//!   but its continuation steps return no `Result`.
//! - [`Refusing`], [`Refuses`] and [`TypedRefusal`]: a command's refusal,
//!   one of its declared typed refusal objects (decision 14.95: typed
//!   refusals only), and [`Unrefusable`], what a command that declares
//!   none fails with.
//! - [`Failed`], [`BusinessStatus`], [`RetryableStatus`] and [`Fails`]:
//!   what a command handler or a continuation step fails with, a business
//!   refusal (under a status of the business set), an immediate return
//!   (ABORTED), a fatal bug, or a retryable bug (under the status it
//!   picks).
//! - [`Refused`]: a refusal of a command a policy sent, as its ONE
//!   Translate callback reads it (decision 14.89).
//! - [`ProcessManager`]: what sets a process manager, a domain, apart: its
//!   starting inputs. [`Compensation`] its rollback (angzarr decision
//!   14.74): each step paired in code with its undo, the failed event and
//!   the completed steps' undos, newest first, a late reply undone at once,
//!   and an undo that becomes a command refused at registration
//!   ([`UndoTargetsCommand`]; decision 14.83).
//! - [`Routed`]: a marked-up domain's handlers, registered on
//!   angzarr-router's table.
//! - [`Policy`], [`Commands`] and [`PolicyContext`]: a policy, its output
//!   and its handler's context. [`Decides`] and [`Ingests`] say what a
//!   domain takes, for the checks on a policy.
//! - [`AsyncProjector`] and [`ProjectionContext`]: a projector.
//! - [`assert_step_idempotent`]: the test helper for a continuation step,
//!   which must be idempotent on its own result (there is no step cap).
//! - [`TypeName`]: a message's package and name, as the generated
//!   constants list them.
//! - [`NoSnapshot`]: the snapshot form of a domain that has none.
//! - The functions the expansion calls, each stable and public, so
//!   anything the markup writes can be written by hand
//!   (`src/hand_written.test.rs` registers an aggregate and a policy
//!   with no macro): packing and decoding ([`pack_message`],
//!   [`type_url_of`], [`decode_message`]); running a domain's handler as
//!   one decision ([`run_command`], [`run_rooted_command`], [`run_fact`]);
//!   a policy's answers ([`policy_answer`], [`translated_fact`]); a
//!   projector's run ([`projecting`]); and a state's descriptor
//!   ([`state_descriptor`]).
//!
//! Every component here assumes nothing about distribution: the same
//! marked-up aggregate, process manager, policy or projector runs in
//! angzarr-embedded's process or as its own service, with no change to its code.
//!
//! angzarr-embedded's `src/decorated.test.rs` runs all of it.
