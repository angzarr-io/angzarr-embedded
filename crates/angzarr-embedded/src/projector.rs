//! Projectors: ONE port, run two ways.
//!
//! A projector is angzarr-router's [`ProjectorHandler`]: handed a book of
//! one stream's events, it answers a `Projection`. A hand-written one, a
//! marked-up one (`#[projector]`, through [`markup::Projected`](super::markup::Projected)) and a
//! remote one (a child's `ProjectorService`, the host's) are the same
//! port, and run either way:
//!
//! - **inline**, registered in the [`Registry`](super::Registry)
//!   ([`Registry::projector`](super::Registry::projector),
//!   [`Registry::projector_handler`](super::Registry::projector_handler)):
//!   the kernel hands it each step's
//!   committed book of its sources and awaits it before the call returns
//!   ([`Kernel::handle`](super::Kernel::handle));
//! - **catch-up**, a [`CatchUp`] the application runs, a step at a time
//!   ([`CatchUp::step`], [`CatchUp::step_if_changed`]) or as a loop
//!   ([`CatchUp::follow`]), on its own runtime: no thread of its own.
//!
//! What a projector is handed, either way, is per stream; no order crosses
//! streams, and nothing numbers across them:
//!
//! - a book of one stream's events, in sequence order, after the last it
//!   was handed of that stream, `next_sequence` the stream's length;
//! - a book whose first page is sequence 0 starts that stream afresh:
//!   whatever it held of a stream on the same cover is gone (one purged,
//!   and written again);
//! - in catch-up, a book with no page and `next_sequence` 0: the stream is
//!   gone (purged), found so by the catch-up's record of what it handed,
//!   which a purge never touches (decision 14.68), and the projector
//!   forgets it.

/// it is on each, through angzarr-ports' one capability for it,
/// [`Processed`], one of two ways:
/// - **held** ([`CatchUp::new`]): in memory, a [`HeldRecord`], for a
///   projection held in memory, rebuilt by its first step from each
///   stream's start. A stream purged and written again is told from the one
///   it replaced by its first event (its cause and when it was recorded),
///   never by its sequence, since each starts at 0: it is handed again
///   from its start.
/// - **stored** ([`CatchUp::stored`]): in the store, its positions under
///   the projector's name, as the kernel keeps a policy's, so a durable
///   projection resumes where it left off in a new process. A stream whose
///   head is below its position is one purged and written again: it is
///   handed again from its start.
///
/// A purge never touches the record. Each step compares it with the
/// store's listing of the sources' streams, read in the step's own read
/// unit ([`ReadUnit::covers`]): a stream it holds that the store no longer
/// lists is gone, purged, whether or not a catch-up ran then. The
/// projector is handed its gone book (its cover, no page, at 0), and the
/// stream is forgotten (stored, its position put back to 0).
///
/// A step reads in one read-only unit ([`ReadStore`]), its listing
/// included: what it hands is one moment of the store, and a write or a
/// purge landing meanwhile is the next step's. Each page is upcast as a policy's trigger is, through its
/// domain's upcast port. A book the projector fails (or that does not

/// the other streams go on. Delivery is at least once: a stored position
