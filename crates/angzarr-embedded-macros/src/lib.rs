//! Decorators over hand-written components. [`aggregate`] and
//! [`process_manager`] generate, from the impl's [`handles_cmd`],
//! [`handles_fact`] and [`applies`] markers, the runtime glue that runs a
//! domain on angzarr-embedded (its `angzarr_embedded::Domain` and
//! `angzarr_embedded::State` impls, routing by type URL), a nameable
//! `<Name>Handler` trait, and its constants. [`policy`] generates a policy's
//! `angzarr_embedded::markup::Policy`, its one Translate callback
//! ([`on_refused`]) included, and [`projector`] a projector's
//! `AsyncProjector`. Hand-writing `Domain` stays first-class; this is a way
//! of writing one, not a layer over it: the expansion calls only
//! `angzarr_embedded::markup`'s documented, stable public functions
//! (`run_command`, `decode_message`, `policy_answer`, ...), so anything it
//! writes can be written by hand (angzarr-embedded's
//! `src/hand_written.test.rs` does).
//!
//! Every component written here assumes nothing about distribution: the
//! same aggregate, process manager, policy or projector runs in angzarr-embedded's
//! process or as its own service, with no change to its code.
//!
//! angzarr-embedded's `src/decorated.test.rs` runs the expansion; the
//! `compile_fail` examples here pin what it refuses.
//!
//! # Where it sits
//!
//! 1. The proto declares the messages and the component: `(component)` on
//!    the anchor, `(command){component, emits, refuses, starts}` on each
//!    command and fact, `(event){component}` on each event.
//! 2. angzarr-cli generates the decorated impls into the build's output
//!    every build: the `#[aggregate]` (or `#[process_manager]`) impl, one
//!    `#[handles_cmd(Cmd)]` handler per command typed from its `emits` and
//!    `refuses` (and marked `starts` where the proto says so), one
//!    `#[applies(Event)]` per event; and, for a policy, the `#[policy]`
//!    impl with its one `#[on_refused]` Translate callback over the
//!    refusals of its target's commands. Each delegates to a generated
//!    trait; `angzarr scaffold rust` writes the user's implementation of it
//!    once, `todo!()` bodies, and never overwrites it. Every handler
//!    returns its events; a continuation step (below) is the user's to add,
//!    where a later event depends on an earlier one's state.
//! 3. The user writes the bodies.
//! 4. This macro generates the glue, the trait and the constants.
//!
//! A command the proto declares and the markup does not handle reaches the
//! router as a type URL it does not know, and is refused at run time as the
//! kernel's unknown type, like any type no domain reads.
//!
//! # The markup
//!
//! ```text
//! #[aggregate(domain = "wallet", snapshot = WalletSnapshot)]
//! impl Wallet {
//!     #[handles_cmd(Deposit)] // lists no refusal: it cannot refuse
//!     fn deposit(&self, cmd: Deposit, ctx: &Context) -> Result<Emit<Self>, Failed<Unrefusable>> { .. }
//!
//!     #[handles_cmd(Hold, refuses(InsufficientFunds, WalletClosed))]
//!     fn hold(&self, cmd: Hold, ctx: &Context) -> Result<Held, Refuses<Self, Hold>> { .. }
//!
//!     #[handles_fact(Payout)] // a fact: no Result, anywhere
//!     fn payout(&self, fact: Payout, ctx: &Context) -> Record<Self> { .. }
//!
//!     #[applies(Deposited)]
//!     fn deposited(&mut self, event: Deposited) { .. }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - [`aggregate`], on an inherent impl:
//!   - `domain`: the `Domain::NAME`, a string literal;
//!   - `snapshot` (optional): the prost message the aggregate is
//!     snapshotted as;
//!   - `vis` (optional, default `pub`): the visibility of the generated
//!     `<Name>Handler` trait. An impl does not carry its type's
//!     visibility, so the scaffold writes the struct's here.
//!   - `command` and `event` (optional): the domain's command and event
//!     enums, its `Domain::Command` and `Domain::Event`, in place of the
//!     ones the macro writes into a module no path names: angzarr-build's
//!     named `<Component>Command` and `<Component>Event`, which carry
//!     their `Payload` impl, or enums written by hand. Either is an
//!     ordinary enum, one variant per type, the variant named as its type,
//!     with a `From` of each type and a `Payload` impl; written by hand,
//!     that impl packs each variant with `markup::pack_message`, reads
//!     each type with `markup::decode_message`, and lists them with
//!     `markup::type_url_of` (`src/decorated.test.rs`'s toggle does). Every
//!     variant of the event enum has its `#[applies]`, or the fold does
//!     not compile.
//! - [`process_manager`], on an inherent impl: the same arguments; see
//!   *Process managers*.
//! - [`handles_cmd`]`(Cmd)`, one per command (a request: it may fail):
//!   `fn(&self, cmd: Cmd, ctx: &Context) -> Result<R, E>`, where `R` is an
//!   `Emits` shape: an event `E`, a tuple `(E1, E2, ..)` of up to four,
//!   `Option<E>`, `Vec<E>`, or an `Emit<Self>` with a continuation whose
//!   steps are fallible too. A variable list of different types is not a
//!   shape (deferred). `E` is `Failed<Unrefusable>` for a command that
//!   lists no refusal, which cannot refuse (decision 14.95), or, with
//!   `refuses(T, ..)`, `Refuses<Self, Cmd>` (see *Typed refusals*). On a
//!   process manager, `starts` marks a starting input.
//! - [`handles_fact`]`(Fact)`, one per fact (a reaction's or the outside
//!   world's: not refusable; "if it can't be refused, it's a fact"):
//!   `fn(&self, fact: Fact, ctx: &Context) -> R`, with no `Result`, where
//!   `R` is a shape or a `Record<Self>`, whose continuation steps return no
//!   `Result` either. A refusal is an event the handler records. On a
//!   process manager, `starts` marks a starting input.
//!
//!   The marker says which a method is, and the macro holds the signature
//!   to it: a `#[handles_cmd]` without a `Result`, a `#[handles_fact]` with
//!   one, or a fact handler with an `Emit`, whose steps may refuse, does
//!   not compile.
//! - [`applies`]`(Event)`, one per event: `fn(&mut self, event: Event)`,
//!   or `fn(&mut self, event: Event, page: &PageContext)` to read where
//!   the event sits, as a handler reads its `&Context`: its stream's cover,
//!   its sequence and its whole `EventMeta` (`recorded_at`, its cause and
//!   a fact's origin, correlation and rules version; for an event of the
//!   decision being made, the metadata it is stamped with when it
//!   commits, so the state decided is the state replayed).
//! - `rooted_by = field` on a [`handles_cmd`]: the command's `field` (a
//!   `String`, or anything `AsRef<str>`) is its natural key, and the
//!   stream's root must be that key's UUIDv5 under the domain
//!   (`Context::rooted_by`, as `Cover::natural` addresses it); a command
//!   sent elsewhere fails before its handler runs, as a bug
//!   (`angzarr-embedded-not-its-stream` the cause of
//!   ANGZARR_REASON_UNHANDLED_HANDLER_ERROR): it is no typed refusal of the
//!   command's.
//!
//! There are no other markers on a domain: a refusal of a policy's command
//! reaches that policy's Translate callback, never a domain, so a domain's
//! `#[on_refused]` does not compile. Stateless rules are not a marker:
//! refusing has no side effects, because the application creates what a
//! command needs inside the same unit of work its events commit in.
//!
//! ## The instance is the aggregate
//!
//! The aggregate's state is its own fields: `Domain::State` is the
//! aggregate type, and the macro generates its `State` impl. There is no
//! separate state parameter.
//!
//! The one aggregate may be, and often should be, **backed by several
//! objects**: its fields are other types with their own methods (a
//! ledger, a schedule, a set of holds), and the aggregate is the gateway
//! and orchestrator over them. Handlers ask those objects and decide;
//! appliers hand each event to the objects it changes. Only the aggregate
//! is marked up; the objects behind it know nothing of commands, events or
//! angzarr-embedded.
//!
//! ## Pure handlers
//!
//! A handler's only effect is the events it returns. It takes `&self`, so
//! it reads the instance and cannot assign to it (a handler that assigns
//! a field does not compile); it has no clock (the time is
//! `Context::recorded_at`, sampled by the application and injected) and
//! does no I/O. The **router** alone changes the instance: it applies the
//! returned events, in order, through the appliers, and records them.
//! Appliers are the only code that assigns state, and applying an event
//! never sets off further processing.
//!
//! **Interior mutability is unsupported.** A `Cell`, `RefCell`, `Mutex`,
//! atomic or anything else that lets `&self` change the instance breaks
//! event sourcing: the change is in no event, so replay and a retry do not
//! reproduce it. `&self` is the only enforcement; nothing checks for it
//! at run time.
//!
//! ## Continuations: events that depend on earlier ones
//!
//! A handler decides from the state before any of its events. Where a
//! later event must be decided from the state after an earlier one, the
//! handler returns `Emit::of(e).then(Self::step)`. A step is a pure
//! `&self` method, `fn(&self, ctx: &Context) -> Result<R, E>`, with `R`
//! any `Emits` shape and `E` anything a handler may fail with
//! (`markup::Fails`: a `Refuses` choice, as is or as a `Failed`, or a
//! `Failed<Unrefusable>`), so a step may chain `.then(..)` again, refuse
//! with one of its command's typed refusals, return at once
//! (`Failed::immediate`), or fail with a bug, fatal or retryable
//! (`Failed::bug`, `Failed::retryable_bug`).
//!
//! The router applies the events, calls the step on the updated instance,
//! applies what it returns, and repeats until there is no continuation:
//! the markup's `Emit` runs as angzarr-router's own (decision 14.104). All
//! of it is **one decision**: a refusal from the handler or any step
//! refuses it all, a bug from any of them fails it all (dead-lettered as
//! the handler's bug), and every step's events are committed together, in
//! order, in one commit. There is no step cap: a step that always
//! continues never ends, so a step must be idempotent on its own result
//! (re-run there, it emits nothing);
//! `angzarr_embedded::markup::assert_step_idempotent` is the test helper.
//!
//! ## Commands and facts
//!
//! If it can't be refused, it is a fact. A **command** (a request: a user,
//! a CLI, an API, a policy) may be refused, if it lists its typed refusals,
//! so its handler returns `Result`, and a refusal goes back to the caller,
//! the domain recording nothing. A **fact** (a timeout, a webhook, an
//! import, a refusal fact from a policy) already happened and is never
//! refused: its handler returns no `Result` and always records an outcome,
//! a refusal included, as an event (`PayoutRefused`). A fact's step cannot
//! fail; only a bug can. angzarr-router hands a fact to its fact handler, a
//! command to its command handler, each registered on the router's table by
//! the expansion (`markup::Routed`).
//!
//! A fact's continuations are infallible too: its handler returns a
//! `Record<Self>`, `Record::of(e).then(Self::step)`, whose step is
//! `fn(&self, ctx: &Context) -> R` with no `Result`, `R` a shape or
//! another `Record`. Same semantics as `Emit`'s (applied, then the step on
//! the updated instance, one decision, no step cap), but nothing in it
//! can refuse.
//!
//! ## Typed refusals
//!
//! A command refuses only with a business-specific, TYPED refusal object
//! (decision 14.95), the markup's spelling of the proto's
//! `(command).refuses`: `#[handles_cmd(Hold, refuses(InsufficientFunds,
//! WalletClosed))]`. Each listed type is a domain type of the command's own
//! domain (a `DomainMessage`, never an event). The handler's `Err` is then
//! `Refuses<Self, Hold>`, a choice the macro builds of exactly those
//! types, each `From` its type: `Err(InsufficientFunds { .. }.into())`. An
//! object not listed does not compile. It goes out as
//! `ANGZARR_REASON_COMMAND_REFUSED` (its `refusal_type` the object's type,
//! the object in the status details) under FAILED_PRECONDITION; to refuse
//! under the business status the refusal message declares, when it is
//! another, or to fail with a bug, the `Err` is `Failed<Refuses<Self, Hold>>`
//! instead: `Err(Failed::rejected(InsufficientFunds { .. }).with_status(..))`,
//! `Err(Failed::bug(&broke))`, the list still checked. A marked-up domain's
//! `Domain::Rejection` is `markup::TypedRefusal`: what its caller matches.
//!
//! A command that lists no refusal cannot refuse (C-0674): its handler's
//! `Err` is `Failed<Unrefusable>`, which holds a bug, an immediate return or
//! a retryable bug only. A domain's own untyped rejection does not
//! compile.
//!
//! ## Four ways to fail
//!
//! A command handler's or a step's `Failed` is one of decision 14.37's
//! four classes, and its status says which:
//!
//! - `Failed::rejected(..)` (business, fatal): a typed refusal under a
//!   business status (FAILED_PRECONDITION, or another of the six with
//!   `.with_status(..)`), to the caller or the issuing policy's Translate
//!   callback; never retried.
//! - `Failed::immediate(&why)` (business, immediate): ABORTED under
//!   `why`'s own code, "re-read and re-decide": back to an outside caller
//!   at once; a policy's step, whose caller is the kernel, is reloaded and
//!   run again under the capped backoff, then dead-lettered.
//! - `Failed::bug(&broke)` (bug, fatal): INTERNAL
//!   ANGZARR_REASON_UNHANDLED_HANDLER_ERROR, `broke`'s code as its `cause`;
//!   dead-lettered at once.
//! - `Failed::retryable_bug(status, &down)` (bug, retryable): the
//!   `markup::RetryableStatus` the handler picks,
//!   ANGZARR_REASON_UNHANDLED_HANDLER_ERROR, `down`'s code as its `cause`;
//!   retried with capped backoff, then dead-lettered with its
//!   `retry_count`. The statuses are not interchangeable: `Unavailable`
//!   means resend (the dependency is down for now); `DeadlineExceeded`
//!   means resend only if the call is idempotent, since the work may have
//!   happened (a command is, by its `command_id`); `ResourceExhausted`
//!   means wait longer before resending (a quota or a capacity limit was
//!   hit).
//!
//! Neither an immediate return nor a bug ever reaches a policy's Translate.
//!
//! ## Process managers
//!
//! A process manager IS A DOMAIN: [`process_manager`] takes the same
//! arguments and markers as [`aggregate`] and generates the same
//! expansion. Its inputs are commands (which policies send it, and which it
//! may refuse) and facts (timeouts, webhooks, refusal facts); its only
//! output is its own events. It has no triggers: it subscribes to no
//! domain, and the policy for (another domain, the PM's domain) turns that
//! domain's events into commands to it. It sends no commands: to act on
//! another domain it records an event carrying the command's data, and
//! the policy for (the PM's domain, that domain) builds the command. Where a
//! workflow's logic belongs together, the PM and its policies run in one
//! process, each policy hop a step committed on its own.
//!
//! What sets it apart, `markup::ProcessManager`:
//!
//! - **Its root is the one its input names.** An input addressed to it
//!   names the instance in its cover, whatever its correlation: one
//!   instance may take inputs of several correlations, its events carrying
//!   each input's. A correlation left unset is given the root. A policy
//!   names the root of every command it sends; "the root is the
//!   correlation" is a convention it may follow.
//! - **The start rule**, the kernel's, by the descriptor's starting types.
//!   Only an input marked `starts`
//!   (`#[handles_cmd(StartBuyIn, starts)]`, `#[handles_fact(F, starts)]`)
//!   may start an instance; `STARTS` lists them. Any other input for a
//!   root with no instance is not delivered, FAILED_PRECONDITION
//!   `ANGZARR_REASON_PM_NO_INSTANCE`, recording nothing: a command is
//!   answered so, a fact dead-lettered. `starts` on an aggregate's handler
//!   does not compile. A process manager that marks no input `starts` can
//!   never start an instance, yet angzarr-embedded does not refuse it: the
//!   check is angzarr-cli's, a generator warning, because a proc macro on
//!   stable Rust cannot warn, and a compile error would be stricter than
//!   the spec.
//!
//! Deduplication is by command id and fact id, before the handler runs,
//! as for any domain, and it has the one handler context every domain has.
//! Its rollback is `markup::Compensation`'s (decision 14.74): every undo
//! becomes a fact of its destination, and a step whose undo becomes a
//! command is refused at registration (decision 14.83).
//!
//! ## Policies
//!
//! ```text
//! #[policy(name = "buyin-wallet", source = BuyIn, target = Wallet)]
//! impl BuyInWallet {
//!     #[on_event(BuyInStarted)]
//!     fn started(&self, event: &BuyInStarted, ctx: &PolicyContext)
//!         -> Result<Commands<Wallet>, Infallible> { .. }
//!
//!     #[on_refused]
//!     fn refused(&self, refused: &Refused) -> Result<BuyInRefused, Unhandled> { .. }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - [`policy`], on an inherent impl: `name` (the component its commands'
//!   ids are derived from), `source` (a `markup::EventSource`: a domain
//!   here, by its type, or a child-hosted domain's event set) and `target`
//!   (a `markup::CommandTarget`: a domain here, by its type, or a remote
//!   domain's command set): one source, one target.
//! - [`on_event`]`(Event)`, one per event of the source it handles:
//!   `fn(&self, event: &Event, ctx: &PolicyContext) -> Result<Commands<Target>, E>`,
//!   pure, called once per trigger event, each command one the target
//!   decides and each fact one it ingests, with the root of its stream (for
//!   a process manager, `ctx.correlation_id()`). It always returns
//!   `Result`; `E` is any `Diagnostic` (`Infallible` for a handler that
//!   cannot fail).
//! - [`on_refused`], on at most one method: the policy's ONE Translate
//!   callback (decision 14.89), `fn(&self, refused: &Refused) -> Result<F, E>`.
//!
//! **Policies should not fail for business reasons**: they react to events
//! the application's own domains created, so an `Err` is a bug, an event
//! the policy cannot answer. So is an event of a type the policy marks
//! that does not decode. Either fails the step as
//! `StepError::PolicyFailed`, a defect (never the business `Rejected`):
//! the step is dead-lettered as a handler's bug, the error's code and
//! args its `cause`, never English, and the policy's
//! position moves past the event (unless the kernel says to stay:
//! `Kernel::on_policy_bug`).
//!
//! ## Refusals
//!
//! When a target refuses a policy's command with a typed refusal, it
//! records nothing, and the refusal takes ONE path (decision 46 #5): the
//! policy's Translate callback is handed it, a `markup::Refused`: the
//! refused command as it was delivered (`refused.command::<Hold>()`,
//! `refused.delivery()`), the target's typed refusal and the status it
//! travelled as (`refused.refusal::<InsufficientFunds>()`,
//! `refused.status()`), and the trigger with its metadata
//! (`refused.trigger()`, `refused.meta()`). It answers `F`, a fact its
//! source ingests (`markup::Translation`: `Ingests<F>` for the source),
//! which the kernel delivers to the exact stream of the triggering event
//! with the refused command's id; the source records its own events, never
//! referring to the target's types. A callback returning anything else
//! does not compile. A refusal the callback does not handle is its `Err`,
//! any `Diagnostic`: a bug, as an `#[on_event]` handler's is, dead-lettered
//! with the refused command, and the policy's position moves past the
//! trigger.
//!
//! There is no pass-through and no declining. A policy with no callback
//! answers every refusal with the bug `ANGZARR_REASON_NO_REFUSAL_HANDLER`
//! (the `markup::Policy::on_refused` default), and the refused command is
//! dead-lettered. A framework refusal (a stream not forked in its edition,
//! a process manager with no instance) is no typed refusal and never
//! reaches Translate: it is dead-lettered.
//!
//! ## Context, refusals and domain types
//!
//! Every domain handler and step takes the one `Context`: the instant its
//! events will be recorded at (`ctx.recorded_at()`), and, as its public
//! field `ctx.command`, angzarr-router's whole `CommandContext` for the
//! input: the stream it decides (`ctx.command.cover`), the next sequence,
//! whether the stream has history, the input's arm (a command's expected
//! sequence as sent, a fact's origin), its identity (its command id and
//! correlation), and, for a policy's input, its causation, the event the
//! policy reacted to.
//!
//! Commands and events are **domain types** (angzarr-codegen's domain
//! layer), each a `DomainMessage` naming the prost message it travels as.
//! A handler never sees a wire type; a handler or applier taking one does
//! not compile.
//!
//! ## Construction, replay and snapshots
//!
//! A marked-up aggregate is registered with its factory, which is its
//! whole registration: `registry.aggregate::<Wallet>(Wallet::default)`, or
//! `registry.aggregate::<Wallet>(move || Wallet::with(config.clone()))` for
//! one that carries immutable reference configuration; a process manager
//! with `registry.process_manager::<BuyIn>(BuyIn::default)`, a policy with
//! `registry.policy(BuyInWallet)`. The kernel builds a fresh instance per
//! stream from the factory, replays the stream's events through the
//! appliers, then calls the handler on the result. No instance outlives
//! its input, and none is shared between streams.
//!
//! With `snapshot = Msg`, the user writes `From<&Wallet> for Msg` and
//! `fn restore(&mut self, snapshot: Msg) -> Result<(), E>` (`E` a
//! `Diagnostic`), and the macro generates the `State` impl from them, with
//! `Msg`'s full name as the state's type. Resuming builds a fresh instance
//! from the factory, then restores it, so the configuration the snapshot
//! does not hold survives. Without `snapshot`, the state has no snapshot
//! form (`State::SNAPSHOTS` is `false`), and every load replays from the
//! start.
//!
//! # The expansion
//!
//! The impl above is kept as written, markers included (each is inert),
//! and gets beside it:
//!
//! ```text
//! // The command, fact and event sets, by type URL, kept out of user
//! // code: a module no path names, holding one variant per marked type
//! // (the command and event sets only where `command = ..` and
//! // `event = ..` name none).

//! A policy's expansion is its `markup::Policy` impl: `NAME`, `Source`,
//! `Target`, `EVENTS`, `on_event`, which decodes the trigger by its marked
//! types, and, with an `#[on_refused]` callback, `on_refused`, which hands
//! it the refusal and packs its fact (`markup::translated_fact`).
//!
//! **Refused by the macro**, each with a message saying why: a second
//! handler or applier for one type; a handler taking `&mut self`; a command
//! handler that lists no refusal and fails with anything but
//! `Failed<Unrefusable>`; a marker's type that is not its method's parameter
//! type; a marked method whose shape is not the one above; a `refuses` type
//! that is not a domain type; `starts` on an aggregate; an `#[on_refused]`
//! on a domain; a second `#[on_refused]` on a policy, or one naming a
//! command; a policy's Translate callback returning anything but a fact of
//! its source; a policy handler's commands for another domain than its
//! target.
//!
//! Which of the messages is a fact is the marker's to say, and the
//! signature is checked against it. Checking the marker against the
//! message's declared kind in the proto is an open question.
//!
//! **Not on angzarr-embedded.** [`rejected`] and [`state_factory`],
//! angzarr-macros' rejection handlers and state factories, are a
//! `compile_error!` here: a refusal reaches the policy's one Translate
//! callback, `#[on_refused]`, and the instance is built by `Default` or the
//! registry's factory, as above.
