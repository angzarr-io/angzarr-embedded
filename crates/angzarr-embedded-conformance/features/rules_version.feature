Feature: Rules version - recording who decided, and choosing snapshots
  Every business binary has a full version, fixed when it is built (for
  example "1.4.2+build.7"). It gives that version, together with its state
  type, when its coordinator asks it to describe its component (see
  component_discovery.feature), and reports the same version with every
  answer. The coordinator records that version, unaltered, on every
  event and snapshot the answer produced, so each event names the build that
  decided it.

  The coordinator alone decides whether a stored snapshot may be used. It
  offers a snapshot only when the snapshot's state type is the registered
  state type and its version passes the domain's compatibility rule against
  the registered version. By default, versions are compatible when their
  major and minor numbers are equal, ignoring one leading "v" or "V"; a
  version that is not a semantic version is compatible only with exactly
  the same version. A domain may
  replace that rule with an accept pattern and an optional reject pattern;
  a reject match always wins, and a pattern must match the whole version.
  A snapshot that is not offered costs nothing but time: business code gets
  the full history from sequence 0 instead. A query is judged by the same
  rule against the answering coordinator's own registration, and uses no
  snapshot while that coordinator holds none.

  Every answer must report the version the binary described: an answer
  reporting any other version is a bug, and nothing it produced is kept.

  Background:
    Given an "order" aggregate registered with state type "/orders.v1.OrderState" and rules version "1.4.2+build.7"

  Scenario: Every event of an answer records the reported version in full
    When business code answers an AddItem command with ItemAdded and ShippingQuoted events, reporting rules version "1.4.2+build.7"
    Then the ItemAdded event records rules version "1.4.2+build.7"
    And the ShippingQuoted event records rules version "1.4.2+build.7"

  @rules_version
  @C-0519
  Scenario: A snapshot returned with an answer records the reported version in full
    When business code answers an AddItem command with an ItemAdded event and a snapshot, reporting rules version "1.4.2+build.7"
    Then the snapshot records rules version "1.4.2+build.7"
    And the snapshot records state type "/orders.v1.OrderState"

  @rules_version
  @C-0520
  Scenario: During a rolling deployment each event names the build that decided it
    Given two instances of the "order" business binary, at rules versions "1.4.2+build.7" and "1.5.0+build.9"
    When the instance at "1.4.2+build.7" decides an AddItem command for order "order-1"
    And the instance at "1.5.0+build.9" decides an AddItem command for order "order-1"
    Then the first ItemAdded event records rules version "1.4.2+build.7"
    And the second ItemAdded event records rules version "1.5.0+build.9"

  @rules_version
  @C-0521
  Scenario: A process manager's own events record the version it reported
    Given a process manager "Fulfillment" registered with rules version "2.0.1"
    When the process manager handles a StartFulfillment command with a FulfillmentStarted event, reporting rules version "2.0.1"
    Then the FulfillmentStarted event records rules version "2.0.1"

  Scenario Outline: A snapshot of the registered state type and the same major.minor is offered
    Given order "order-1" has a snapshot at sequence 5 of state type "/orders.v1.OrderState" recorded under rules version "<snapshot version>"
    And order "order-1" has events at sequences 6 and 7
    When the coordinator delivers an AddItem command for order "order-1"
    Then business code receives the snapshot at sequence 5
    And business code receives the events at sequences 6 and 7

    Examples:
      | snapshot version |
      | 1.4.2+build.7    |
      | 1.4.0            |

    And order "order-1" has events at sequences 0 to 7
    When the coordinator delivers an AddItem command for order "order-1"
    Then business code receives no snapshot
    And business code receives the events at sequences 0 to 7
    And the command succeeds

    Examples:
      | snapshot version |
      | 1.3.9            |
