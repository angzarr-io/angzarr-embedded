//! A child's health as its supervisor judges it: the child protocol's
//! supervision (angzarr-project's `docs/design/child-protocol.md`, section
//! 8; decision 14.63).
//!
//! Every check interval the supervisor sends the child a grpc.health.v1
//! `Check` of its overall server, within a deadline ([`check`]), beside the
//! health watch it holds from the handshake on: a child wedged with its
//! watch still SERVING answers no check. Each time it sees the child's
//! health, by a check or its watch, it asks [`Vitals::seen`] what to do:
//! publish it (up), withdraw it (down: unhealthy, its calls failing
//! retryably), restart it (unhealthy for its whole grace, unbroken), or
//! give it up (so, past its component's restart limit: it stays down).
//!
//! The checks run on a [`Clock`]: tokio's, or in a test one the test moves
//! itself.
