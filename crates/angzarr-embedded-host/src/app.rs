//! The application: an [`App`] built from its parts ([`App::builder`]: a
//! registry, where its streams are kept ([`Stores`]), and the kernel's
//! settings), or [`run`] from its config, what the CLI's generated
//! `main.rs` calls.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), angzarr_embedded_host::HostError> {
//!     let app = std::sync::Arc::new(angzarr_embedded_host::run("angzarr.yaml", register).await?);
//!     // app.handle(book, &sampled).await from any task, concurrently;
//!     // app.events(&cover).await, app.kernel(), ...
//!     app.shutdown().await; // or drop it: the children stop
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! // From its parts: a store per project, a log of the dead letters' lines.
//! let app = App::builder(projects, registry)   // projects: impl Stores<Key = Project>
//!     .dead_letter_log(log)
//!     .on_retryable(retry)
//!     .start()
//!     .await;                                   // each store at_start names, resumed
//! app.handle_in(&project, book, &sampled).await;
//! ```
//!
//! The [`App`] is `Send + Sync` and its methods are async, on the caller's
//! runtime: commands run concurrently, and nothing orders streams against
//! each other (ordering is per stream only). Two commands to one stream
//! race optimistically: both decide, the store takes one write, and the
//! loser is decided again on the new head, unless it set an expected
//! sequence, which makes the loss its business failure. [`run`]'s store is
//! ONE SQLite connection, which serializes the I/O and nothing else.
//!
//! Dead letters are durable (owner ruling Q5, 2026-10-31): a store that
//! keeps them (an angzarr-ports `DeadLetterStore`, as SQLite's is) holds
//! every letter a step with no caller left wrote, in that step's write;
//! every call answers the letters it wrote; and a log the application
//! supplies ([`AppBuilder::dead_letter_log`]) also gets each as its line.
//! The host writes to no terminal: what it would say goes back to its
//! caller ([`App::resumed`], [`Unserved`]).
//!
//! The host's children are started and stopped off the caller's workers
//! (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`): the App has no runtime of its own, and
//! the caller's runtime is tokio's, with its timer.

// The kernel's own Failure, as Kernel::handle_any returns it, is what
// every call of the App answers.
