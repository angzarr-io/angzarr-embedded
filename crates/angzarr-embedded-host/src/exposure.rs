//! The exposure seam: what the host's listener (later, one gRPC server
//! serving `CommandHandlerCoordinatorService`, routed by `cover.domain`)
//! calls for each request, [`App::serve`](crate::App::serve). It takes the
//! request's book and where the request arrived from, and answers as
//! `CommandHandlerCoordinatorService.Handle` does, in core's messages (the
//! kernel's [`Answered`](angzarr_embedded::Answered), from which the listener
//! builds the distributed transport's `CommandResponse`; decision 14.64), or
//! the kernel's refusal. A domain is served only when its `component` entry's
//! `expose` admits the arrival ([`Expose`]): a request on loopback reaches
//! a component exposed `"loopback"` or `"ip"`, one from the network only a
//! component exposed `"ip"`. A domain not exposed to the arrival is
//! answered exactly as an unknown domain is (the kernel's
//! `Malformed::UnknownDomain`), so a caller cannot tell a hidden domain
//! from a missing one; the real reason ([`NotExposed`]) goes back to the
//! listener beside that answer ([`Unserved::Hidden`]), for it to log
//! locally: the host writes to no terminal of its own.
