//! The host: launches every remote component of a [`HostConfig`], waits for
//! its handshake, connects, describes it, and hands back a handler of its
//! kind (a [`RemoteCommandHandler`] per domain, a [`RemotePolicyHandler`]
//! per policy, a [`RemoteProjectorHandler`] per projector) to register with
//! the application's registry beside its in-process ones. Then it
//! supervises: a child that
//! exits is restarted, after a backoff that grows while restarts fail, and
//! one unhealthy past its grace is restarted at once, up to its limit;
//! while it is down its handler's dispatch is retryable
//! ([`crate::is_retryable`]). A restarted child is described again, and its
//! component registered by its new descriptor before it is published
//! (C-0563): a registered domain's whole descriptor is replaced, and a
//! child describing another component (another name or kind, or a policy
//! or projector of other inputs or another output domain) is not published.
//!
//! Every child's gRPC health (`grpc.health.v1`, its server's, service
//! `""`) is watched from its handshake on, as the child protocol has every
//! child serve it, and checked every `health_check_interval_ms` with a
//! `Check` given `health_check_deadline_ms` (the protocol's supervision,
//! decision 14.63; [`crate::vitals`]): a child is up while it is running
//! and its health, as last seen by either, is SERVING, and down (its calls
//! retryable, cause `not-serving`) while it is not, a check unanswered
//! within its deadline included; a watch that ends reports nothing more.
//! A described child must report SERVING once it has handshaken, before
//! it is described; an upcaster sidecar, which is not described, may come
//! up down. A child down for `unhealthy_grace_ms`, unbroken, is stopped
//! at the first check (or watch report) past it and launched again at
//! once, up to `unhealthy_restart_limit` times for its component; past
//! that, it is stopped and none launched, its calls retryable (cause
//! `not-running`) until the host ends. A call in flight on a child that
//! is stopped fails retryably, and is never sent again.
//!
//! The generated `main.rs` calls [`crate::run`], which holds the
//! in-process registrations to the config's listing; by hand, in
//! outline:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let config = config::parse(include_str!("angzarr.yaml"), "angzarr.yaml")?;
//! let host = Host::start(config)?;
//! let mut registry = Registry::new();
//! registry.aggregate::<table::Table>(Default::default)?; // in-process
//! host.register(&mut registry)?; // every remote component, by its kind
//! let kernel = Kernel::new(&registry);
//! // ... kernel.handle_any(&store, book, &sampled) for any domain;
//! // dropping `host` stops the children.
//! ```
//!
//! The host supervises its children on a tokio runtime of its own, on its
//! own threads, so starting and stopping it works the same under any
//! caller; an async caller does both off its workers
//! (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`), as [`crate::run`] does. A remote
//! component's calls are not the host's: each is awaited on the caller's
//! runtime, which must be tokio's, with its timer.
