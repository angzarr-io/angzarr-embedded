# Messages for angzarr-embedded-host's errors. Each id is an error's code
# without the crate's name, which the build prefixes
# (angzarr_diagnostic::build); the variables are its args. Messages are
# lowercase fragments, like the English Display, so they read well inside
# another message. A condition the spec keys is coded under its key, whose
# English is the spec's catalog (angzarr_proto::REASONS_EN_US; decision
# 14.60), never here.
